Currently, users are public because there is no login.  If a user wants to make an new blog, he would select his name from a dropdown menu as the blog's author.  As log in validation gets further implemented, blogs will be readonly by everyone except the author.

TODO's: Blog entries, comments on blog entries, comments on blogs,  perhaps some sort of friending.
